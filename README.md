# UnCAPTCHA
Using deep learning to beat text-in-image-based CAPTCHA! Trained and tested with data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/captcha-images).

## Introduction
Text-based CAPTCHA, Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart, are meant to be a defense mechanism against bots. We have created two models– a segmentation-based CNN and a CRNN– that can consistently beat text-based CAPTCHAs within two to three attempts. We hope to prove that text-based CAPTCHAs no longer serve their purpose and should be replaced with better alternatives such as ReCAPTCHA.
